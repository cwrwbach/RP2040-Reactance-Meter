# RP2040-Reactance-Calculator
Counter using one slice of the PWM module.
To be used as a Capacitor and Inductor measurement tool.
Uses Pi4 as a development machine, Mincom for debug and SWD for Loading debug.

f = 1 / (2π √L C)   Resonant Frequency

L = 1 / (4π*4π f C)   Ind

C = 1 / (4π*4π f L)   Cap
